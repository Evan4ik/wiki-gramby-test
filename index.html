  <p> Comedy (from the Greek: κωμῳδία, <i>kōmōdía</i>) is something EVERYONE thinks they are good at. But they are clearly not. The only good comedian is Rowan Atkinson. Good night. </p> <br> <p>Satire and political satire use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as <br>ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor. Parody subverts popular genres and forms, critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them.

Other forms of comedy <br> include screwball comedy, which derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters, and black comedy,
    <br> which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature. Similarly scatological humor, sexual humor, and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comic ways. <br><br><br><br><br><br> A comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper-class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. Romantic comedy is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love. </p>
